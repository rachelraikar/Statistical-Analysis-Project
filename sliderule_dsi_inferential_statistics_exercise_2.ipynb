    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

The statistical analysis was performed using the bootstrap and frequential statistical method. To perform these methods, the null hypothesis was that race had no impact on callback rate. Therefore population proportions of black and white sounding names should have a similar rate ($p_w = p_b$ or $p_w - p_b = 0$). The alternative hypothesis was that the race of the name affected the callback rate so the population proportions would not be equal ($p_w \\neq p_b$ or $p_w - p_b \\neq 0$). \n",

From the p-values calculated from both test methods, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis since the p-value $\\approx 0$ which is less that the significance level of 0.05. Thus concluding, that race does play a role in callback rates.\n",

After testing all other possible factors using statistical analysis, we can compare the results and confidently say whether race is the most important factor."
